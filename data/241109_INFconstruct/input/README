Design of fused IFN-beta (Interferon beta) + inhibitor fused together.
Inhibitor is fused through a linker part of which is protease specific.
PQ19, Q7 and Z1 refer to pieces of the linker specific for those proteases

See BinderLinkerCleavable.py  run_Tempering_Binder.py for details

Description of the different constructs:

==============================
Reference model: ***Binder_30AA_linker_10AA: ***
Binder with 30 AA, linker 10 AA. Binding region is (helix) residues in the interval [ 80, 100 ], where the positions are numbered based on the bare protein (IFN).
Each construct is made as a single fused protein of the form: 
30AA Binder - 10AA linker - 10AA Protease recognising region  - 10AA linker - IFN(protein)
So in practice the first 50 residues in the .pdb are the binder+linker, the next are the protein
==============================

Binder_40AA_linker10AA:
As reference model above but now the binder is 40 AA in total

==============================
Binder_40AA_linker10AA_wider:
As reference model  but binder is 40 AA in total AND the targeted region is the interval [ 55, 135] on the protein

==============================
Binder_50AA_wider:
As reference model but the binder is 50 AA in total, the targeted region is again the interval [ 55, 135] on the protein

==============================
Binder_30AA_linker_4AA
As reference model but now the linker is 4+protease_region+4 = 8 + protease = 18 AA in total

==============================
Binder_30AA_linker_7AA:
As reference model but now the linker is 7+protease_region+7 = 14 + protease = 24 AA in total
